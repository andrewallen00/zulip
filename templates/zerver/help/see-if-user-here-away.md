### User List

You can see if a user is active on Zulip by looking at the user list
located on the far right side of your screen.

### Search people

The **Search people** field at the top of the user list
allows you to search for a specific user.
As start typing the user list will shrink
to show users that match your search.

If you mouse over a user's name on the user list,
you will see a small chevron (![chevron](/static/images/help/chevron.png)).

Clicking on this chevron brings up a menu like the one below.

### Color Indicators

User status is marked by small circles to the left of a user’s name:

 * A green circle
   (![green circle](/static/images/help/green_circle.png)) means the
   user is currently active on Zulip.

 * A white circle (![white circle](/static/images/help/white_empty_circle.png))
   means the user is inactive.

 * A orange half-filled circle
   (![orange circle](/static/images/help/orange_half_circle.png))
   means the user was recently active.

 The same information is available by mousing over a given user’s name.

 If you have sent a group private message to multiple individuals,
 their names will appear in a group at the bottom of the right sidebar.
 In that case:

 * A pale green
 circle (![pale green circle](/static/images/help/pale_green_circle.png)) indicates that some members of the group were recently active,
 while the state of other members is unknown.

 * A solid green circle
 (![green circle](/static/images/help/green_circle.png)) means all members of the group are active or were recently active.

 * An empty green circle (![green circle](/static/images/help/green_empty_circle.png)) means that no members of the group are active or were recently active.
